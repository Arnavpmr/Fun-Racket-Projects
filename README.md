###Fun Racket Coding Challenges

This repository contains a collection of fun coding challenges that I completed using the Racket programming language. The challenges vary in difficulty and cover various programming concepts.
Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply clone or download it onto your local machine.
Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Racket installed on your machine. You can download Racket from the official website.
Running the Code

Each challenge is contained in a separate file with a descriptive name that indicates the problem being solved. To run a challenge, simply open the corresponding file in DrRacket and click the "Run" button.
Challenges

Here is a list of the challenges included in this repository:

    FizzBuzz.rkt: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

    Palindrome.rkt: Write a program that determines whether a given string is a palindrome or not.

    Factorial.rkt: Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number.

    Anagrams.rkt: Write a program that determines whether two given strings are anagrams of each other.

    BinarySearch.rkt: Write a program that performs a binary search on a sorted list of integers to find a specific value.
