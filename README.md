### Introduction

This repository contains a collection of fun coding challenges that I completed using the Racket programming language. The challenges vary in difficulty and cover various programming concepts.

### Description

This repository is intended to provide Racket programmers with a set of fun coding challenges to solve. Each challenge is contained in a separate file and covers a specific programming concept. The challenges vary in difficulty, making this repository suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers.

### Challenges

Here is a list of the challenges included in this repository:
* 1. CourtYardTiling.rkt:Given a n by n board where n is of form 2k where k >= 1 (Basically n is a power of 2 with minimum value as 2). The board has one missing cell (of size 1 x 1). Fill the board using L shaped tiles. A L shaped tile is a 2 x 2 square with one cell of size 1Ã—1 missing.
* 2. TreeMethodSolver.rkt: Write a program that generates a truth tree to verify an assumption about a set of logical statements. The program should take in the logical statements as input and construct a truth tree based on the rules of propositional logic. The truth tree should be used to determine whether the assumption is valid or not. The program should output the truth tree and a statement indicating whether the assumption is valid or not, as well as a list of contradictions if the assumption isnt valid.
